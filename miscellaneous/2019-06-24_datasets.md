Software development time estimates  

Derek M. Jones analyzes software-engineering data. Recently, he convinced a small software company (Software in Partnership Ltd (SiP)) to release a dataset documenting its internal time estimates, spanning 10 years, 20 projects, and 10,000+ tasks. For each task, the dataset indicates the number of hours it was predicted to take, how long it actually took, the (anonymized) developers it was assigned to, and more. [h/t Erik Bern]
