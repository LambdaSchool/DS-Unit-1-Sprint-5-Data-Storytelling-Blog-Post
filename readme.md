#### In 1930 Einstein did what he does best. He stumbled upon a  peculiarity of quantum particles that he dubbed "Spooky Action".  He also ####was quick to dismiss the properties of these particles as nonsense.

####Thus beginning a decades long squabble among the physics community. A Battle between Einstein and Bohr.  In 1964 the truth of the ####matter came to light, through photons that is.  There was finally proof of quantum entanglement.

####Entanglement  involves a pair of particles linked by the strange quantum property  where two particles are so deeply linked that they ####share the same existence. It is these particles, their superposition, and their properties of entanglement that, if controlled ####correctly, can usher in a new information age.

####This post will uncover some of the curious nature of entanglement and superposition and explain the importance of learning to control ####entanglment.
